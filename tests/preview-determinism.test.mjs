/* Preview-capture determinism.
 *
 * The documentation screenshots are committed, so they are only meaningful if
 * they can be reproduced. Two defects made that impossible, and both are pinned
 * here rather than left to a comment:
 *
 *   1. the fixture derives its expiry from the wall clock, so the same product
 *      renders a different date on a different day;
 *   2. the page derives its expiry caption from the *reader's* clock, so even a
 *      fixture pinned to a fixed instant renders one day less on a later day;
 *   3. the preview server serves sixteen of the seventeen designs out of
 *      dist/templates/**, which `npm run build` does not write, so a capture
 *      could photograph stale artifacts and still report success.
 *
 * The fixture override that fixes (1) must not be reachable from the product,
 * the shim that fixes (2) must be installed before the page's own scripts run,
 * and the preflight that fixes (3) must run before the browser does. All three
 * are asserted below, together with a real all-template build so the freshness
 * invariant is executed rather than described.
 *
 * A reproducible capture is still only useful if the committed set is the one it
 * produced, so the manifest is also held to the files on disk: every entry must
 * exist, at the size and sha256 it claims, at the dimensions of its mode, and
 * the declared totals must be the real ones.
