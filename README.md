## GoldApp custom layer

- **Gold** — a dedicated black/navy + premium-gold design built on the proven Signature layout and RTL rules.
- **Independent release channel** — Gold-Template installers and updates are prepared to follow this repository instead of silently pulling upstream releases.
- **Upstream-friendly** — the original 17 designs remain core/byte-locked; Gold is an unlocked custom tier, so upstream updates can be merged with less friction.
- **CLI compatibility** — the existing `row-template` command and install paths are intentionally kept for now to avoid breaking deployed hosts.

> Gold-Template is a derivative distribution. Original Row-Template authorship, licenses and bundled third-party licenses remain credited and must be preserved.

## What it is

3X-UI, PasarGuard and Rebecca can each serve a custom page to subscribers instead of their built-in one. Row-Template is that page: a subscriber opens their subscription link and sees their plan, their usage, their expiry date, and one-tap ways to add the subscription to the app they use.

It ships as one self-contained HTML file per design, with every style, script, font, and the QR code generator inlined, and a version of each design in every panel's own template language. A single command detects your panel, installs the page next to it, points the panel at it, and gives you a `row-template` manager for branding, updates, and rollback.

## Why Row-Template?

- **Private by design.** The page your subscribers open makes no third-party requests. QR codes are generated on the page, and your branding is injected as text — never executed, never sent anywhere.
- **Genuinely white-label.** Your service name, your support link, your logo. Nothing on the served page identifies Row-Template.
- **Seventeen designs, one file each.** Pick the look that fits your service. Every design shares the same features, languages, and safety checks — on every supported panel.
- **Made for your subscribers.** Live usage and expiry, one-tap import into popular apps, and a searchable list of individual configurations for adding a single server by hand.
- **Safe to operate.** Checksum-verified releases, transactional activation that restores the panel exactly if any step fails, and one-command rollback. It never patches your panel: on 3X-UI it changes one setting (`subThemeDir`), on PasarGuard it adds one marked block to `.env`, and on Rebecca it sets two fields of its subscription settings.

## Designs

Gold-Template currently carries the 17 upstream designs plus the custom **Gold** design. Row remains the compatibility default; use `RT_TEMPLATE=gold` for the GoldApp look.

Choose a design during a fresh interactive install, set `RT_TEMPLATE` for a scripted one, or change it later from the manager (**Reconfigure branding → Template**). Updates keep your choice. The `RT_TEMPLATE` values are `row`, `editorial`, `canvas`, `prism`, `terminal`, `pulse`, `brutal`, `arcade`, `sketch`, `signature`, `saffron`, `pulsenova`, `prismnova`, `terminalnova`, `arcadenova`, `meter`, `notebook`, and `gold`.

## Features

**For your subscribers**

- **Live status.** Plan state, traffic used and remaining, and expiry, refreshed from your panel while the page is visible — on 3X-UI, PasarGuard and Rebecca alike.
- **One-tap import** into popular apps, grouped by platform: v2rayNG, Happ and sing-box on Android; Streisand, V2Box and Shadowrocket on iOS; Clash Verge Rev, Mihomo Party and v2rayN on Windows; Clash Verge Rev, Streisand and V2Box on macOS. On PasarGuard, the applications you list in the panel (Settings → Subscription → Applications) take their place, with your descriptions and download links.
- **Copy and QR.** Copy the subscription link or scan it as a QR code generated on the page.
- **Configuration Explorer.** Every server on its own row, with a country flag or monogram and a protocol label (VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, Hysteria/Hysteria2, WireGuard, AmneziaWG, Telegram MTProto), plus per-configuration QR and copy, and search for long lists. Flags are drawn by an embedded Twemoji font, so every country's flag shows on every platform — Windows included.
- **Five languages** — English, Persian, Arabic, Russian, and Chinese — with right-to-left layout, and a System / Light / Dark theme choice.

**For you**

- **White-label branding.** Service name, support link, and logo, all optional, stored as data and injected as text. On PasarGuard and Rebecca, a fresh install offers the name and support link already set in the panel.
- **A manager for everything.** An interactive menu and direct commands for branding, updates, verification, rollback, and uninstall.
- **Stable-channel updates.** `row-template update` installs the latest stable release, verified, whenever you run it — which also makes it a quick repair.

**Privacy and safety**

- **No third-party requests** from the served page: no CDNs, no external QR or geolocation lookups, no telemetry. Live status comes from your own panel.
- **Mandatory SHA-256** verification of every release download, with no option to skip it.
- **Atomic activation.** A new page is generated and validated before it replaces the live one, so a failed step never leaves a broken page live.
- **Fail-closed panel detection.** A panel counts as installed only when independent signals agree; a half-installed panel, or a panel database that is not a valid SQLite database, is refused rather than guessed at.

## Supported panels

| Panel | Status | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| [3X-UI](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui) (MHSanaei) | ✅ Supported | Requires version **>= 3.6.0** |
| [PasarGuard](https://github.com/PasarGuard/panel) | ✅ Supported since 1.3.0 | PasarGuard **5.x** — the official Docker install or a source install (`pasarguard.service`) |
| [Rebecca](https://github.com/rebeccapanel/Rebecca) | ✅ Supported since 1.3.0 | Rebecca **1.x**, the Go edition (Rebecca's binary install). Automatic activation with SQLite and `sqlite3`; with MySQL/MariaDB, one setting to enter in the dashboard. **Not supported:** the Docker image, which is still Rebecca 0.0.x (the Python edition) — the installer refuses it and changes nothing |

The three panels use three different template engines — Go `html/template`, Jinja2 and pongo2 — so every design is built once per panel, and each version is tested by rendering it with that panel's real engine. The installer detects which panel is on the server; on a server with more than one, it asks (or reads `RT_PANEL`). **Supported** means all seven capabilities are present on that panel — detect, install, activate, verify, backup, restore and uninstall — and each one is exercised by the test suite. See [Compatibility](https://iitzseridev.github.io/Row-Template/compatibility/) for the details of each panel.

**Limitations in 1.4.0:**

- **Rebecca's Docker image is refused.** It is still 0.0.x, the Python edition; install Rebecca 1.x with its binary installer (`rebecca-binary.sh`).
- **One setting by hand** when automatic activation is not possible: 3X-UI without `sqlite3`, and Rebecca on MySQL/MariaDB or without `sqlite3`.
- **Panel settings still take precedence** on PasarGuard and Rebecca: an admin's own subscription template, and PasarGuard's **disable subscription template** setting. `row-template verify` reports both.
- **Clash templates** are not produced; only the subscription page is.
- **PasarGuard application icons are not shown.** The page loads nothing from another site, so an icon address set in the panel is not used.
- **Flags come from a code or an emoji, never from a name.** An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code in the node name (`TR | Istanbul`, `RU-01`, `GB-LON-1`, `DE`) draws that country's flag, as does a flag emoji. Country *names* and *city names* (`Turkey - Istanbul`, `Finland Helsinki`) are **not** inferred and keep the monogram.
- **One panel per server.** An installation serves the panel it was installed for; to serve a different one, run `row-template uninstall` first.

```

- **One file per design.** `tools/build.mjs` inlines the shared runtime, the translations, the fonts, and the QR generator into a design's layout, and refuses a layout that is missing any hook the runtime needs. `tools/verify.mjs` then rejects an artifact that loads anything remote or carries a forbidden construct.
- **The panel does the rendering.** The page is a template: the panel fills in the subscriber's data when it serves it. For PasarGuard (Jinja2) and Rebecca (pongo2) each design is wrapped in a small prelude that maps the panel's own data onto the page and escapes every value.
- **The installer never patches your panel.** On 3X-UI it points `subThemeDir` at its own directory; on PasarGuard it places the page in the templates directory and appends one marked block to `.env`; on Rebecca it places the page and sets the page and directory fields of its subscription settings. Each change is snapshotted first and restored exactly if anything fails.

| Path | What lives there |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `src/` | The page's runtime, styles, and translations; each design in `src/templates/<id>/` |
| `template/index.html` | The built Row page, committed |
| `tools/` | Build, verification, release, and the Go fixture renderer |
| `installer/` | `install.sh`, the `row-template` command, its management library, and one adapter per panel in `installer/panels/` |
| `tests/` | The test suites |
| `docs/` | The documentation site; design records in [`docs/design/`](docs/design/README.md) |

## GoldApp preset

For a GoldApp-branded install, use the Gold design and brand values explicitly:

```bash
RT_TEMPLATE=gold RT_SERVICE_NAME="GoldApp Online" RT_SUPPORT_URL="https://go.goldapponline.ir" \
  bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

The legacy `row-template` CLI name is intentionally retained for compatibility.

## Installation

> **Recommended OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x86_64).** Other modern Linux distributions may work but have not had the same validation coverage.

**Requirements:** a server running 3X-UI **>= 3.6.0**, PasarGuard **5.x**, or Rebecca **1.x** (its binary install; the 0.0.x Docker image is not supported); root access to it; and `curl`, `tar`, and `sha256sum` (present on virtually all Linux systems). Automatic activation on 3X-UI and Rebecca also needs `sqlite3`.

Run as **root** on the server that hosts your panel:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

The installer:

1. Downloads the latest stable release from GitHub.
2. Verifies its SHA-256 checksum (mandatory — no bypass).
3. Detects your panel, extracts the release safely and installs to `/etc/3x-ui/sub_templates/row-template` (3X-UI) or `/etc/row-template` (PasarGuard, Rebecca).
4. On a fresh install, offers the design chooser (Enter keeps Row).
5. Prompts for your branding (service name, support link, logo — all optional).
6. Generates and validates the page, then activates it in the panel where possible.

To choose a design without the chooser, for example in a script:

```bash
RT_TEMPLATE=editorial bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

On a server that runs more than one supported panel, the installer asks which one to serve. A scripted (non-interactive) fresh install on such a server **must** name it with `RT_PANEL` (`3xui`, `pasarguard` or `rebecca`); without it, the installer stops before changing anything:

```bash
RT_PANEL=pasarguard bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

`RT_PANEL` must name a panel that is installed on that server. A re-run or an update keeps the panel Row-Template was installed for.

On PasarGuard and Rebecca, a fresh install also offers the service name and support link already set in the panel's own subscription settings. To take them in a script, set `RT_PANEL_BRANDING=1` (`RT_PANEL_BRANDING=0` never offers them, and `RT_SERVICE_NAME` and `RT_SUPPORT_URL` always win):

```bash
RT_PANEL_BRANDING=1 bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
```

If you prefer not to pipe from the network, download the four release assets (`install.sh`, `manifest.txt`, `SHA256SUMS`, and `row-template-<version>.tar.gz`) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/zarkmakerburg/Gold-Template/releases/latest) into one folder, verify the checksum yourself as described in [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md), and point the installer at that folder:

```bash
RT_RELEASE_DIR=/root/row-template-release bash /root/row-template-release/install.sh
```

### Activation

An interactive install shows what activation will change and asks first. On PasarGuard and Rebecca, activation runs as a transaction: the panel's state is snapshotted, changed, verified, and — if any step fails — restored exactly.

**3X-UI.** Row-Template installs to a directory that the panel serves as its subscription page:

```
/etc/3x-ui/sub_templates/row-template
```

- **Automatic:** when `sqlite3` is available, Row-Template sets it for you. It briefly stops the panel service, writes the setting, starts the service again, and checks the value.
- **Manual:** otherwise, open **Panel Settings → Subscription → Profile → Sub Theme Directory** and enter exactly:

  ```
  /etc/3x-ui/sub_templates/row-template
  ```

**PasarGuard.** The page is placed at `/var/lib/pasarguard/templates/row-template/index.html` (or inside your own `CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIRECTORY`, if you set one), and a marked block is appended to `/opt/pasarguard/.env`:

```
# >>> row-template (managed by Row-Template; do not edit) nl=0 >>>
CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIRECTORY = "/var/lib/pasarguard/templates"
SUBSCRIPTION_PAGE_TEMPLATE = "row-template/index.html"
# <<< row-template <<<
```

PasarGuard reads `.env` at start-up, so a running panel is restarted once. None of your own lines are edited; uninstall removes the block and returns `.env` to its exact previous bytes. An admin with their own subscription template, or the **disable subscription template** setting, still takes precedence — `row-template verify` tells you when either applies.

**Rebecca.** The page is placed at `/var/lib/rebecca/templates/row-template/index.html` (or inside your own custom templates directory), and Rebecca's subscription settings are set to `row-template/index.html`. Rebecca reads them on every request, so no restart is needed.

- **Automatic** with the default SQLite database and `sqlite3` installed.
- **Manual** with MySQL/MariaDB (or without `sqlite3`): the page is still placed; in the Rebecca dashboard open **Settings → Subscription → Templates** and set **Subscription page template** to `row-template/index.html` and **Custom templates directory** to `/var/lib/rebecca/templates`.

Row-Template supports Rebecca **1.x**, the Go edition, which Rebecca publishes for its binary install (`rebecca-binary.sh`). Docker Hub's `rebeccapanel/rebecca` image is still the 0.0.x Python edition, which cannot render this page; the installer refuses it and changes nothing. Install Rebecca 1.x with Rebecca's own binary installer (`rebecca-binary.sh`) to use Row-Template.

## Usage

Run the manager with no arguments in a terminal to open the interactive menu:

```bash
row-template
```

Or use a command directly:

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `row-template config` | Change the service name, support link, or logo, then regenerate the page |
| `row-template update` | Download, verify, and activate the latest stable release (checksum enforced) |
| `row-template rollback` | Restore a previous version (`--auto` or `--to <backup>`) |
| `row-template verify` | Check the install, the panel wiring, and the live page (as root, it also puts back missing or misplaced designs) |
| `row-template version` | Show the installed version and the panel it serves (on 3X-UI, also the minimum-supported and detected versions) |
| `row-template uninstall` | Remove Row-Template and return the panel to the page it had before |
| `row-template help` | Show usage |

Commands that change the system (`config`, `update`, `rollback`, `uninstall`) must run as root.

- **Branding** is stored as data, never executed, and injected into the page as text. Leave a field blank for an unbranded page. The support link accepts only schemes a browser should open, such as `https://…`, `tg://…`, or `mailto:…`.
- **Updates** come from the public stable channel. `row-template update` always applies the latest stable release, even the version you already run; the manager's **Update** compares versions first and asks before changing anything. If the release source is unreachable, nothing is changed and your installation is never treated as damaged.
- **Updating from 1.1.0, 1.2.0 or 1.3.x** takes one `row-template update`. 1.1.0's own updater copies only part of the new release, so the next `row-template`, `row-template config`, or `row-template verify` run as root first downloads the rest of that same release — every design, checksum-verified. Your design, branding, and panel wiring are kept. Earlier releases did not install on PasarGuard or Rebecca; there, run the installer.
- **Rollback** restores a previous version from a validated backup. The current version is snapshotted first, so a failed rollback can be recovered, and your branding is preserved. Backups record the panel they were made on and are never restored onto another; a backup from an older release that does not name its design restores as Row. A rollback restores the page and the version it records, not the `row-template` manager itself: after rolling back to a 1.1.0 backup, `row-template version` reports 1.1.0 while the 1.4.0 manager stays in place, and the next `row-template update` returns to 1.4.0. Only the two newest backups are kept — each update, design switch, and rollback makes one.
- **Uninstall** removes Row-Template's files and returns the panel to the page it had before: on 3X-UI it clears `subThemeDir` only if it points at Row-Template; on PasarGuard it removes its `.env` block and its page; on Rebecca it restores the two subscription settings it changed (leaving them alone if you have since chosen another page). Your users, inbounds, clients, nodes, and certificates are not touched.

The [documentation](https://iitzseridev.github.io/Row-Template/) covers configuration, branding, and troubleshooting in more depth.

## Development

The pages are built from readable sources in `src/`. You need Node.js 22 or newer; to run the tests, also Go 1.22 or newer and Python 3 with Jinja2 (`pip install jinja2`), which render the PasarGuard and Rebecca pages with those panels' real engines.

```bash
npm run build          # regenerate template/index.html from src/
npm run verify         # check the built page against the safety gates
npm test               # render the fixture pages, then run every test suite
npm run fixtures:all   # render every design's fixture pages on their own
npm run lint:sh        # ShellCheck every shell script
npm run preview        # preview the fixture pages at http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

The build is deterministic — the same sources always produce a byte-identical `template/index.html`. The documentation site is a separate workspace in `docs/`; see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Testing

- **`npm test`** renders every design's fixture pages with the Go renderer, then runs the suites: the page's scripts, the build, every design's artifact, the PasarGuard and Rebecca pages rendered by real Jinja2 and pongo2 (including hostile and malformed data), the release payload, and the installer — which runs the shipped shell library and every panel adapter in real `bash` against throwaway hosts laid out like each panel's official install.
- **`npm run verify`** checks a built page against its safety gates, including: a whole document, every build marker substituted, everything inlined, no remote references, no forbidden constructs, intact translations, and no invisible characters in the sources.
- **`npm run lint:sh`** fails on any ShellCheck error; `npm run lint:sh -- -S warning` shows the full report.
- **The Docs workflow** builds the documentation site on every pull request that changes it.

## Roadmap

Direction, not promises:

- **Custom templates** — a proposal for adding your own design: [`docs/design/CUSTOM-TEMPLATES-PROPOSAL.md`](docs/design/CUSTOM-TEMPLATES-PROPOSAL.md).
