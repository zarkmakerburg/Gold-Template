#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Gold-Template bootstrap installer.
#
# Public one-command UX:
#
#   bash <(curl -fsSL https://github.com/iitzSeriZdev/Gold-Template/releases/latest/download/install.sh)
#
# With no environment set it downloads from the public GitHub stable channel
# (releases/latest/download resolves to the newest published, non-prerelease
# release, over https, with no API token). The source can be overridden for
# local testing or air-gapped staging:
#
#   RT_RELEASE_DIR=/path/to/release   bash install.sh      # staged local dir
#   RT_RELEASE_URL=https://host/path  bash install.sh      # alternate HTTP repo
#
# The bootstrap deliberately contains only the *minimum* self-contained logic
# needed to solve the chicken-and-egg problem: it fetches and checksum-verifies
# the release tarball, safely extracts it, then sources the extracted management
# library and hands the ENTIRE install transaction to rt_cmd_install. All the
# substantive work (structural validation, staging, backup, atomic activation,
# panel wiring, verification) lives in the library — this script never becomes a
# second implementation of it. The library also re-verifies the payload, so a
# bug here cannot bypass the integrity gate.
