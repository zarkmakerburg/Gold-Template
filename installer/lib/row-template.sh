#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Gold-Template management library.
#
# Sourced by installer/install.sh (bootstrap) and by the installed CLI at
# /usr/local/bin/row-template. It carries every operation the administration
# layer performs: environment discovery, configuration, template generation,
# atomic install, backup/rollback, verification and uninstall.
#
# Design rules honoured throughout:
#   - No runtime dependency on node/go/python/jq/sqlite3. Standard Linux
#     userland only (bash, coreutils, curl, tar, sha256sum, awk, sed, od).
#   - Administrator-supplied text (service name, support URL) is treated as
#     DATA, never as shell. It is stored base64-encoded and injected into the
#     template as JSON string literals. config.env is never sourced/eval'd.
#   - The panel's own subscription source tree is never written to; Gold-Template
#     lives under its own external root. 3x-ui source is never patched.
#   - Every production file replacement is staged, validated, then swapped with
#     an atomic rename. A failed step never truncates the working install.
#
# The entry scripts set `set -Eeuo pipefail` and an ERR trap; functions here
# use explicit checks and return codes so they behave under that regime.

# The Gold-Template install root, per panel:

#   PasarGuard/Rebecca /etc/row-template                      (1.3.0+)
#
# 3X-UI's root is deliberately under /etc/3x-ui (created and owned by us) and
# NOT under the panel's config root, which may be /etc/x-ui; subThemeDir is an
# absolute path, so the two are independent. It never moves: every 3X-UI host
# since 1.0.0 has its install, its subThemeDir and its CLI pointed there. The
# other panels get a neutral root rather than a directory named after a panel
# the host does not run; their page is placed into the panel's own template
# directory by that panel's adapter. The installer picks the root once it knows
# the panel (rt_root_set); the CLI finds whichever one is installed.
#
# RT_ROOT in the environment overrides both (tests, unusual layouts), and an
# explicit RT_ROOT is never moved.

# --- template store self-healing ---------------------------------------------
# Every reader above looks in ONE place, RT_TEMPLATE_STORE. A store anywhere
# else is invisible, and the manager then reports that no design is installed
# while the files sit one directory away. Two states lead there on real hosts:
#
#   ABSENT     v1.1.0's updater installs this library but copies only four
#              files, so no design arrives with it (rt_complete_install).
#   MISPLACED  a release payload lays its designs out at templates/<id>/; a
#              payload copied or extracted over the install root leaves them
#              at $RT_ROOT/templates, beside dist/ instead of inside it.
#
# rt_repair_template_store heals from what the host already has; install,
# update and verify all run it, so a path mistake is repaired by whichever
# command meets it first and no operator has to move a file by hand.

# --- snapshot format model (Phase 8E reader, P2 writer) -----------------------
# THE DEFECT, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT REPEATED: `meta` is written by
# rt_backup_create and read by nothing. A grep of this library returns only the
# two writes. Anything a future format stores must be readable FIRST — a value
# written into a file no code reads is a value no rollback can use.
#
# FORMAT MODEL
#   1  the shipped 1.1.0 snapshot. No `format` marker, no `manifest`, no
#      `panels/`. ABSENT MEANS FORMAT 1 — treating "absent" as "unknown" would
#      make every existing backup unreadable.
#   2  panel state, a manifest, and a canonical `format` marker file. Written
#      only under $RT_BACKUPS_V2, and only by rt_backup_create_v2.
#
# A TOUCHED PANEL DIRECTORY (format 2) HOLDS EXACTLY THESE, and a directory
# missing any of them is an incomplete snapshot rather than a panel with nothing
# to record:
#   selection.state   absent | empty | present  — the ACTION a restore takes
#   selection         the raw previous value, only when state=present
#   meta              mechanism=db|env|api and was_running=0|1
#   files             the relative paths we placed, one per line, always written
#                     (empty when we placed nothing). Both target panels resolve
#                     templates relative to their own directory, so the paths are
#                     RELATIVE — an absolute path could not be checked against a
#                     recorded root before removal (B11) and would invite a
#                     removal outside the panel's tree.
# The `files` list is what makes rollback remove OUR file without ever removing
# the operator's directory, which may hold templates that are not ours.
#
# NAMESPACES
#   $RT_BACKUPS      format-1 snapshots. The shipped 1.1.0 library discovers
#                    this and nothing else, so a format-2 snapshot must never
#                    land here: the old library would find a valid template.html
#                    + sidecar, restore them, and leave the panel selection
#                    pointing at the directory it just replaced. That is the
#                    half-rollback, and a separate namespace prevents it
#                    structurally rather than by convention.
#   $RT_BACKUPS_V2   format-2 snapshots. Only a library that understands format
#                    2 reads it.
#
# P2 IS INERT WITH RESPECT TO ROLLBACK. rt_backup_latest, rt_backups_prune and
# rt_cmd_rollback are untouched and still read $RT_BACKUPS only. The v2
# discovery helpers below exist for tests and for the phase that wires rollback
# to v2; no production path calls them.

  # WHY THIS EXISTS. PasarGuard and Rebecca both place a file into a directory

  # work. Without a record of which files we placed, rollback has no way to
  # distinguish them, and the only options left are "delete the directory"
  # (destroys operator content) or "delete nothing" (leaves our file behind and
  # the panel pointing at it). Neither is a rollback. See
  # INSTALLER-BACKUP-REVIEW.md §1 and INSTALLER-MULTIPANEL-DESIGN.md §9 rule 1.
  #
  # PATHS ARE RELATIVE, to the panel's own managed root, and are validated by
  # rt_backup_relpath_ok — the SAME closed grammar the writer uses, so a path
  # the writer emits can never be one the reader refuses. An absolute path is
  # NOT stored: it cannot be checked against a recorded root at restore time,
  # and both target panels resolve templates relative to their directory anyway.

  # untrusted input like any other file.
  #
  # Exit: 0 with the list (possibly empty) when valid; 1 when malformed. A
  # touched panel directory WITHOUT a `files` file is malformed — the writer
  # always emits one, so its absence means the snapshot is incomplete, not that
  # no files were placed. That distinction is the whole reason an empty file is

Gold-Template — custom subscription page manager for 3X-UI, PasarGuard and Rebecca
by iitzSeriZdev — https://github.com/iitzSeriZdev/Gold-Template

Usage:
  row-template                Open the interactive manager (when run in a terminal)
  row-template <command> [options]

Commands:
  config      Change the service name, support URL or logo, then regenerate
  update      Download, verify and activate a newer release (checksum enforced)
  rollback    Restore a previous version  [--auto | --to <backup-dir>]
  verify      Check the install, panel wiring and live render (as root, also
              restores missing or misplaced designs)
  version     Show the installed version and panel (and, on 3X-UI, its version)
  uninstall   Remove Gold-Template and revert the panel to its built-in page
  menu        Open the interactive manager explicitly
  help        Show this help

Run with no arguments in an interactive terminal to open the manager; in a
non-interactive context (scripts, CI, curl | bash) it prints this help instead.

Commands that change the system (config/update/rollback/uninstall) must run as root.

# --- panel interface (P3) -----------------------------------------------------
# The frozen installer-side panel contract. It is sourced EXPLICITLY, not
# globbed: the set of files that can alter installer behaviour must be fixed
# and reviewable, and a directory glob would let a stray file join it. Both
# files are inert at load time  --  they define functions and constants only, and
# every public entry point reports UNAVAILABLE until P5 implements a panel.
#
# The order matters in one direction only: interface.sh defines the contract
# and the internal stubs; index.sh defines the registry and dispatch that
# interface.sh resolves against at CALL time. Neither reads the other at load
# time, so the order is a readability choice, not a load-bearing one.
#
# ABSENT is not the same as BROKEN. A host updated to this version by the
# 1.1.0 updater has no panels/ directory: that updater copies only the library
# and the CLI, and nothing in a release can change what it copies. Refusing to
# load there would leave every `row-template` command dead, including the
# `update` that installs the layer. So an absent layer loads WITHOUT it:
# rt_panels_load returns 2, RT_PANELS_LOADED stays empty, rt_installer_complete
# reports the gap, `verify` names it and `update` repairs it. No command calls
# a panel operation today; one that ever does must check rt_installer_complete
# first, so it meets a reported gap rather than an exit 127. A layer that is
# PRESENT but fails to load is damage, not an older updater, and still fails
# loudly at source time.
rt_panels_load() {

# behaviour of its own; see installer/lib/transaction.sh for the contract.

# resolves rt_panel_* at CALL time. Absent and broken are told apart exactly as
